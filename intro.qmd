# What's This Book About?

This book is about getting the gist of writing code in Pyspark using the Databricks platform as fast as possible.

I don't know about you, but I prefer to learn things when they are stated directly as possible too. That will then be our goal as we go through the content.

The intended teaching philosophy of this book is to allow you (the learner) to jump right in from the get-go with Pyspark and Databricks through first fiddling with small examples and then eventually becoming more granular in terms of depth while we ask ourselves some questions as we explore.
